# This project has been removed from PyPi

I have decided to remove minesweeperPy from PyPi as I believe the code due to how old it is and due to my rather limited programming knowledge at the time, is rather bad.
I have even remade allot of the code allot more efficiently in my own personal projects. If you would like to still use this module you can by installing it via `pip install git+https://github.com/SkylaDev/minesweeperPy.git` however I would recommend you make your own or look online for better examples of Minesweeper generation.
Thankyou for the 41k downloads of this module while it lasted, and gl with your fun programming adventures! <3
